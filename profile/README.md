## a little bit of an intro to the github org


### Repository organization
We currently have 3 repositories.
- [software](https://github.com/satquest/software)
- [electronics](https://github.com/satquest/electronics)
- [hardware](https://github.com/satquest/hardware)

The 4th one (`discussions`) is designated to house the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/satquest/discussions), which will probably be unnecessary, considering we have Discord.
Each repo is hooked up to the channel #git-pushes in each subteam's Discord channel category. 

> [!WARNING]
> Mute that shit **immediately** unless you want to get spammed.

### Projects
There are 4 projects in total.

- `Roadmap` - general roadmap and kanban for the whole project (the one which we'll screenshot and add to the slides and then expand upon further on). It is housed in the root of the github org.
- And then `Software`, `Hardware`, `Electronics` which are for internal planning in the respective subteams, housed in their respective repositories.

Ideally, for the benefit of maximized documentation, the workflow of managing these projects would be as follows:

1. Create an issue in the repository you're working on
  - Assign members
  - Describe the goal
  - Add labels
  - Go crazy with it
2. Add it to the corresponding project
3. If it is of big importance, add to `Roadmap` as well

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Create issues in the repos and then add them to the corresponding project(s)**, instead of opening the project and inserting a task in it. That shit gets really confusing really fast.
